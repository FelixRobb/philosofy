    description:
      "When time was limited, your brain defaulted to faster, more instinctual decision pathways rather than deliberative ones. This shift from System 2 to System 1 thinking (as described by Kahneman) is automatic and beyond your control.",

    description:
      "Each choice reinforced certain traits, making similar choices more likely in future scenarios. This self-reinforcing causal loop creates the illusion of consistent character while actually demonstrating deterministic processes.",

    name: "Stress Influence",
    description:
      "Your stress level affected which brain regions dominated your decision-making process. High stress shifts control from the prefrontal cortex to more primitive brain regionsâ€”a neurological process beyond your conscious control.",
