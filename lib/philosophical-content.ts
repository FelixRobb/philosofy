  compatibilism:
    "Compatibilists like Daniel Dennett argue that determinism is compatible with a meaningful concept of free will. Even if your choices were causally determined, they were still your choices, arising from your character and values.",
  hardDeterminism:
    "Hard determinists like Baruch Spinoza maintain that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is completely determined by previously existing causes. Free will is an illusion arising from our ignorance of these causes.",
  neuroscience:
    "Neuroscientific research by Benjamin Libet and others suggests that our brain activity determines our decisions before we're consciously aware of making a choice, challenging the notion that conscious will initiates action.",
  causalChain:
    "Your decision here was part of an unbroken causal chain stretching back to the beginning of the universe. As Laplace's demon would argue, given complete knowledge of all particles and forces at any moment, your choice was theoretically predictable.",
  illusionOfChoice:
    "As Sam Harris argues, the feeling of having alternative possibilities is itself an illusion. The option you didn't choose couldn't have been chosen, given the exact state of your brain at the moment of decision.",
